## Introduction

The Kintex-7 FPGA provides a powerful platform for developing high-performance applications. By integrating the LS055R1SX04 5.5-inch 2K LCD, you can create stunning visual displays for your projects. This repository offers a comprehensive guide to help you set up and use the display effectively.

## Features

- **High Resolution**: 2K resolution for sharp images and text.
- **MIPI DSI Interface**: Enables high-speed data transfer.
- **FPGA Compatibility**: Designed for Kintex-7 series FPGAs.
- **Open Source**: Contribute and modify as per your needs.
- **Example Projects**: Ready-to-use code samples for quick setup.

## Hardware Requirements

To get started, you will need the following hardware:

- **Kintex-7 FPGA Development Board**: Ensure it supports MIPI DSI.
- **LS055R1SX04 5.5-inch LCD Display**: This is the specific model used in this project.
- **Power Supply**: Make sure to provide the correct voltage to the display.
- **Connecting Wires**: Use appropriate connectors for MIPI DSI.

## Software Requirements

You will need the following software tools:

- **Xilinx Vivado**: For FPGA design and programming.
- **Verilog**: The hardware description language used in this project.
- **MIPI DSI Driver**: Ensure you have the necessary drivers installed.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Code**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Laavaan-J/Kintex-7-MIPI-DSI-5.5-inch-2K-LCD/releases) to download the latest version of the project files.
2. **Install Vivado**: Make sure you have Xilinx Vivado installed on your machine.
3. **Open the Project**: Launch Vivado and open the downloaded project.
4. **Configure the FPGA**: Follow the instructions in the project documentation to set up the FPGA configuration.
5. **Connect the Display**: Use the connecting wires to link the Kintex-7 board to the LCD.
6. **Run the Code**: Execute the provided Verilog code to initialize the display.

## Code Overview

The code in this repository is structured to facilitate easy understanding and modification. Here are some key components:

- **Top Module**: The main module that initializes the display.
- **MIPI DSI Controller**: Manages communication between the FPGA and the LCD.
- **Display Driver**: Contains functions to control display settings and content.

### Example Code Snippet

```verilog
module display_controller (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output wire mipi_dsi_clk,
    output wire mipi_dsi_data
);

// Initialization code here

endmodule
```

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start using the display. Here are some examples of what you can do:

- **Display Images**: Load and display images on the screen.
- **Show Text**: Render text in various fonts and sizes.
- **Interactive Applications**: Create applications that respond to user input.
